While taking the course, I kept getting kicked off of Google Colab and had issues with keeping the GPU resource accessible so I figured out the setup needed to run the notebooks in Miniconda and Jupyter.

$ conda create --prefix ./env pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter seaborn tensorflow-hub tensorflow-gpu tensorflow-datasets pydot pydotplus python=3.7

* After the initial install, you'll need to install/change some specific package versions

** You must have the environment activated before installing these additional packages **

$ conda install tensorflow-estimator=2.4.1
$ conda install -c conda-forge google-auth=1.35.0
$ conda install -c conda-forge numpy=1.19.5
$ conda install -c conda-forge xgboost

* These supposedly takes advantage of Intel chips

$ conda install scikit-learn-intelex -c conda-forge
$ conda install dpcpp_cpp_rt -c intel

* I ended up not needing the following (tensorflow-probability) package since they changed the code during the video but I'll leave it here just in case it's needed in the future.

$ conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow-probability=0.12.2



... ONE-TIME LINUX THING ....

* I saw a CUPTI_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED issue that comes up in one of the notebooks. This is done outside the conda environment and only needs to be done once.

* In the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory:

$ sudo touch nvidia-kernel-common.conf
$ sudo gedit nvidia-kernel-common.conf

* add the following line:

options nvidia "NVreg_RestrictProfilingToAdminUsers=0

* reboot the machine


Notes: 

1. While I swear I loaded the correct version of tensorflow-estimator (i.e., 2.4.1) somehow it got promotoed to 2.6.x. Maybe by a subsequent package install? I ended up getting an error on the first Transfer Learning notebook when I tried to import tensorflow, tensorflow_hub and tensorflow.keras. It looks like google-auth got overridden somehow too ... had to reinstall v1.35.0.
